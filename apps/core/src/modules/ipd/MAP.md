# ipd — module notes

Hand-written notes: the WHY and the traps. Signatures are generated in `docs/architecture/modules/ipd.md`.
Paths are relative to `apps/core/src/modules/ipd/` unless they start with a module name, `kernel/`, `scripts/`,
`packages/` or `apps/`. Citations name a file and a symbol, never a line number. The spec is
SPEC-ipd-core-2026-10-12 §4.1 (kept outside the repository); the plan is decision 0072, issue #715 (E0.3).

## 1. Purpose
The inpatient module. E0.3 starts it with the BED REGISTRY: every floor, ward, hall, room and bed of the
hospital as rows of the kernel resource registry (`kernel/resources`), with IPD's own facts about a bed and a
ward kept in `resources.attributes`. Later lanes add the bed board, admission, transfer, nursing and discharge.
There is no manifest, Nest module, route or permission yet: nothing here is reachable over HTTP.

## 2. Key files (owner of what)
- `bed-attributes.ts` — `IpdBedAttributesSchema` (class, gender rule, isolation, negative pressure, ICU flag,
  equipment, day care, overflow) and `IpdWardAttributesSchema` (department code, unit type, ward or hall). The
  rules live in the schema's refinements: airborne needs negative pressure; class `overflow` ⇔ `overflow: true`;
  class `daycare` ⇔ `daycare: true` (DECIDED, E0.3); no equipment tag twice.
- `bed-layout.ts` — `parseBedLayoutCsv` (header row 1; refuses missing or unknown columns), `validateBedLayout`
  (pure: rows → plan or every problem), `loadBedLayout` (diff and, with `apply`, write in one transaction) and
  `formatBedLayoutReport` (the dry-run summary).
- `errors.ts` — `IpdError`; `bed_layout_invalid` carries `detail.problems`.
- `packages/contracts/src/ipd-bed-classes.ts` — `IPD_BED_CLASSES` and `IPD_BED_CLASS_INFO` (census and rates
  flags). Shared with the rate card lane: do not rename its exports.
- `scripts/load-bed-layout.ts` — `runBedLayoutLoad`: `--file`, `--by`, `--apply`. Not a seed.
- `scripts/data/gen-ipd-bed-layout.ts` — `planningBedLayoutCsv` writes `scripts/data/ipd-bed-layout.planning.csv`.

## 3. Invariants
- A bed is a kernel `bed` row. No new resource kind, no kernel edit, no migration: the attributes are jsonb,
  validated here, and only the keys the schemas name are written. Other keys on a row are kept.
- The loader validates the WHOLE file first. One bad row refuses the file, every bad row is listed by its
  spreadsheet row number, and nothing is written.
- Idempotent upsert by code (`resources_site_kind_code_lower_ux`: site, kind, lower(code)). A second run of the
  same file writes nothing: no row, no history, no event.
- The loader never deletes, retires, moves or revives. An IPD bed (a bed row whose attributes carry `class`)
  missing from the file is reported as "not in file" and left alone. A code already used by a place under a
  different parent, or by a retired place, refuses the file: moving and un-retiring are a person's acts.
- Dry run is the default. `--by` must hold `auth.users.manage` (DECIDED until the bed board declares IPD's own
  bed-master permission): `scripts/load-bed-layout.ts` `BED_LAYOUT_LOADER_PERMISSION`.

## 4. Traps
- `docker/prod/deploy.sh` runs every seed on every deploy. The loader is a script a person runs; never wire it
  into a seed.
- PLANNING LAYOUT from the confirmed bed split; the hospital's real room list replaces it. The workbook is
  1,150 beds (720 wards, 240 critical care, 50 NICU/SNCU, 20 LDR, 60 day care, 60 emergency); the rest of the
  1,200 is dialysis stations and theatres, which are not beds. Edit the generator, regenerate, commit both:
  `test/ipd-bed-layout-planning.test.ts` compares the file to the generator byte for byte.
- `scripts/data/` must hold only `.ts` files except files a script takes as an argument
  (`test/scripts-data-compiles.test.ts` `TAKEN_BY_ARGUMENT`); the planning CSV is listed there.
- Codes are unique per kind across the whole site, not per ward: a bed code must carry its ward
  (`F05-ORT-M-B12`), or two wards' "B12" collide. OT recovery bays are kernel `bed` rows too; their codes are
  not IPD's, and a clash refuses the file rather than adopting the bay.
- The loader writes ~1,600 rows through `createResource` (history row and event each). The planning workbook
  takes ~10 s on the build host; the acceptance tests give it 300 s.

## 5. Callers
- `scripts/load-bed-layout.ts` (operator). Nothing else yet.
